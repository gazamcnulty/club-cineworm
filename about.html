        <h2>About Club Cineworm</h2>
        <h3>Club Identity</h3>
        <p>
            Club Cineworm is a welcoming place for people to talk about movies and books. Our main focus is adaptations ; popular books which are then made into films. This allows anyone to take part, if you just read the book or saw the movie , or if you have a perspective on both which can be fun to compare.
        </p>
        <h3>Club History</h3>
        <p>
            Club Cineworm began in 2018 , from a likeminded group of people on an irish movie forum , who all happended to live in Dublin. Since then the group has grown in size and popularity. The covid pandemic shifted the club into a zoom based format, but ultimately many of us were grateful to have a regular outlet to speak to friendly members about films and books. After the lockdowns ended it was decided to keep zoom calls as a meetup method every now and then, as well as our usual coffee and cinema meet ups.
