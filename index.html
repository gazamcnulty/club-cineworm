            <h3>Creator Highlight</h3>
            <p>Over the month of January, we will look at authour Philip K. Dick, the seminal science fiction writer best known for the novels Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? , The Man In The High Castle , A Scanner Darkly, and short stories such as Minority Report and We Can Remember It for You Wholesale. Many of his works were adapted into films, Bladerunner being the most influential.<br>
            In our schedule this month, we will read a selection of his works, view the corresponding films and then meet to discuss our thoughts on them. As always, you don't need to have both read the book and seen the film, if you have thoughts on either version then feel free to come along and engage in the discourse!</p>
